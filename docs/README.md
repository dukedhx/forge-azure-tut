# Learn Autodesk Forge

Learn the basics of authentication, data management, file translation, and model rendering, with our quickstart guides.

## What is it?

Forge enables companies to leverage design and engineering data to develop custom software applications and connected workflows for manufacturing, media/entertainment, architecture, engineering, and construction.

- **View 3D models directly in your browser**: The Viewer allows you to embed, interact with, and retrieve meta data about design files in over 50 formats right in your browser, without having to install extra software.
- **Centrally manage data**: The Data Management API allows you to access your data across A360, Fusion, and the Object Storage Service.
- **Convert your design files to formats that unlock their potential**: Use the Model Derivative API to prepare files for the Viewer, extract geometries, retrieve metadata, and more, from over 50 different industry-standard formats.
